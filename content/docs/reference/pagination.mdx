## Overview

This documentation outlines how pagination is implemented in the UserClouds APIs.

## Why Paginate?

In scenarios where datasets may be large, loading all data at once can lead to performance issues, increased latency, and memory exhaustion. Pagination addresses these challenges by dividing the data into smaller portions, allowing clients to retrieve a page of data at a time.

This results in:

- **Enhanced Performance**: Loading smaller data portions reduces latency and response times.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Reduces memory consumption by fetching only necessary data.
- **Improved User Experience**: Faster loading and seamless user interactions.

## Parameters

Our API uses the following query parameters to facilitate pagination:

- `starting_after`: Specifies the cursor value after which the returned list will start.
- `ending_before`: Specifies the cursor value before which the returned list will end.
- `limit`: Sets the maximum number of results per page.
- `filter`: Provides a filter clause to refine the pagination query.
- `sort_key`: Determines the field(s) used for sorting results.
- `sort_order`: Sets the sort order for each field, either ascending or descending.
- `version`: Indicates the API version to be called.
