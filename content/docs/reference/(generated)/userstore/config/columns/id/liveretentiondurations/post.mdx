          This endpoint updates all specified Live column purpose
          ColumnRetentionDurations for a tenant column. For each retention
          duration, if id is nil and use_default is false, the retention
          duration will be created; if id is non-nil and use_default is false,
          the associated retention duration will be updated; or if id is non-nil
          and use_default is true, the associated retention duration will be
          deleted. Each column purpose retention duration that has been deleted
          will fall back to the associated purpose retention duration.
