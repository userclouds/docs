          This endpoint deletes a column by ID. Note that deleting the column
          doesn't result in data deletion - it just results in the data being
          immediately unavailable. To delete the data stored in the column, you
          need to trigger the garbage collection process on the column which
          will remove the data after a configurable retention period.
