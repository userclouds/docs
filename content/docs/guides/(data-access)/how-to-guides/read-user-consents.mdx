There may be circumstances in which you would like to read a user's full set of data processing <Glossary>consent</Glossary>s. For example, you might want to offer a preference management page in your application, through which a user can review and manage their consents. 

You can read an existing user's consents by calling the [ListPurposesForUser API](/reference/post_userstore-api-consentedpurposes). This endpoint lists all consented purposes for a specified user.
