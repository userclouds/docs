## Customizing Emails

You can customize each email in the Email Experience Card on your Application Settings page. You can customize:

- Sender Email Address
- Subject
- Email Body

## Formatting Emails

The text input for the email body is HTML-enabled, to allow linking out to pages like your Terms of Service or Privacy Policy pages. However, the only accepted HTML elements are:

- **Paragraphs**: `<p>`  `</p>`
- **Hyperlinks**: `<a>`  `</a>` with the href attribute
- **Line breaks**:  `<br>` `</br>`

## Personalizing Emails

You can also add parameters to the email, using the format `{{varName}}` or by clicking the suggested parameters at the bottom of each input box.
