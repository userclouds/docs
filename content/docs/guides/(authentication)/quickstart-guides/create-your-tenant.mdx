## 1. Create an account

UserClouds is invite-only right now. If you don’t have an invite, please email [team@userclouds.com.](mailto:team@userclouds.com.) Click the link in your email invite and create a username and password. Congrats! You’ve now experienced UserClouds as an end-user.

## 2. Name your organization and tenant

If you’re setting up your company’s account with UserClouds, you’ll be prompted to name your organization and your first tenant.

- **A company** is a collection of users and tenants. It allows you to group applications together and collaborate with team-mates. Typically, customers set up one organization for their company.
- **A tenant** is a single instance of UserClouds's tech (APIs, user store etc). Each tenant can handle multiple applications. Typically, customers set up one tenant per environment (e.g.. dev / testing / production). We also see enterprise-facing companies create a separate tenant for each one of their customers if/where they need data isolation.

## 3. Rename your application

You’ll land on the Authentication Page for your Tenant in UserClouds. This is where you can configure your tenant’s applications, underlying IDPs, Social and 3rd Party IDPs and settings.

UserClouds automatically creates a Default Application for each tenant.

- **An application** is a single OAuth2 client that can call the APIs of any IDPs configured in your tenant (e.g. primary - Auth0, back-up - Plex, third party - social). It is where you will configure how authentication works for your project. For example, you might configure the application to require two factor authentication via SMS or offer passwordless login.

To rename your application, click into the application, hit edit, change the name, and click Save. In UserClouds, you must always click Save to commit your changes.

Hooray! You created your first application in UserClouds. Now let’s see how to add UserClouds to your software.
