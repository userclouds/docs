Once you have designed the structure of your model, it's time to build your database of <Glossary>object</Glossary>s and <Glossary>edge</Glossary>s in UserClouds. This can be done in two steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>Migrate over from a pre-existing identity system &nbsp;</Step>
  <Step>
    Implement UserClouds's APIs to [populate the graph with
    objects](/docs/reference/authz/objects/post) and
    [edges](/docs/reference/authz/edges/post) on an ongoing basis &nbsp;
  </Step>
</Steps>

If you are building your product or user base from scratch, you will skip straight to step 2.

## 1. Migrate from a pre-existing identity system

UserClouds supports mass migration from pre-existing AuthN and AuthZ systems, like Auth0 and Cognito.

## 2. Implement Write APIs in your software

Maintaining your authorization graph is simple with UserClouds's CRUD APIs. These allow you to [create Objects](/docs/reference/authz/objects/post) and [Edges](/docs/reference/authz/edges/post) programmatically in your application.

For more information on the APIs for Authorization, check out our [Authorization API Docs](/docs/reference/authz/objects/post).
