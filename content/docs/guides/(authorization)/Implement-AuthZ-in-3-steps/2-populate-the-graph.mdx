Once you have designed the structure of your model, it's time to build your database of <Glossary>object</Glossary>s and <Glossary>edge</Glossary>s in UserClouds. This can be done in two steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Migrate over from a pre-existing identity system
    &nbsp;
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Implement UserClouds's APIs to [populate the graph with objects](/docs/reference/post_authz-objects) and [edges](/docs/reference/post_authz-edges) on an ongoing basis
    &nbsp;
  </Step>
</Steps>

If you are building your product or user base from scratch, you will skip straight to step 2.

## 1. Migrate from a pre-existing identity system

UserClouds supports mass migration from pre-existing AuthN and AuthZ systems, like Auth0 and Cognito.

_Docs coming soon! For help migrating over from your existing AuthZ system, please donâ€™t hesitate to email us at [info@userclouds.com](_mailto:info@userclouds.com) ._

## 2. Implement Write APIs in your software

Maintaining your authorization graph is simple with UserClouds's CRUD APIs. These allow you to [create Objects](/docs/reference/post_authz-objects) and [Edges](/docs/reference/post_authz-edges) programmatically in your application.

For more information on the APIs for Authorization, check out our [Authorization API Docs](/docs/reference/post_authz-objects).
