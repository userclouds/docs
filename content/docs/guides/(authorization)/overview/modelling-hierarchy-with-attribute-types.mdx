In this article, you will learn how to model relationships and arbitrarily deep hierarchy between <Glossary>object</Glossary>s in your system with attribute scopes. By the end of this article, you will understand the fundamentals of modeling:

- **Folder-like structures** where objects contain other objects (ad infinitum)
- **Organizational structures** where users can be members of different teams
- **Social structures** like families and friends of friends

The article assumes you know what <Glossary>object</Glossary>, <Glossary>edge</Glossary>s, attributes and <Glossary>permission</Glossary>s are. For more detail, see our [Key Concepts](/docs/guides/overview/key-concepts) article.

## Attribute Scopes

Attributes give one object permissions on another object. Each attribute has an <Glossary>attribute name</Glossary> (like `edit`) and an <Glossary>attribute scope</Glossary>. The value describes the permission and the scope describes which two objects are affected by the attribute. There are three scopes of attribute: direct, inherit and propagate. 

## Direct Attributes

The direct scope is the simplest attribute scope. It gives the source object the permission on the target object. It is used for non-hierarchical relationships.

## Inherit Attributes

The inherit attribute scope states:

> Inherit: if the target <Glossary>object</Glossary> has the attribute on a third object, the source object ‘inherits’ that attribute on the third object.

**Inherit attributes are used to pass a permission from one user or group to another**. In the example below, Gloria is a member of a department that owns a particular project. This is modeled by giving the department direct view access on the project, and passing that view access to Gloria with an inherit attribute.

## Propagate Attributes

The propagate attribute scope states:

> Propagate: if a third <Glossary>object</Glossary> has the attribute on the source object, the third object also gets the attribute on the target object

**Propagate attributes are used to propagate permissions down a hierarchy of nested resources**. In the example below, Ajay owns a folder and has view access to that folder. Ajay is given view access to all files inside the folder with a propagate attribute.
