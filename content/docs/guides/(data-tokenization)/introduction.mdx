Tokenizer allows you to generate a substitute token that can be used in place of the data without compromising privacy. You can think of the token as a reference to the data instead of the data value itself. By working with a reference, you avoid having to move the associated policy and data use restrictions everywhere the data value propagates.

This section shows you how to:

- Create secure, privacy-preserving tokens for your sensitive data
- Allow applications or employees to exchange tokens for the original raw data
- Run individual or bulk operations on tokens through the Tokenizer SDK
