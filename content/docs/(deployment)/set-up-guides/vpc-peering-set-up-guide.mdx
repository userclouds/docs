## VPC Peering Deployment Guide

Peering VPCs is currently a manual process involving several steps:

1. Collect the required information to set up peering connections
   1. Which AWS accounts and VPCs do you want to peer?
   2. What are the CIDR block(s) dedicated to those VPCs?
2. Contact your UserClouds team to get our AWS account and VPC ID information.
3. Create a peering request by following the AWS instructions here.
4. UserClouds’ infrastructure team will accept the request
5. Configure the appropriate route tables to ensure data is routed correctly across the peering connection
6. \_(optional) \_Configure internal DNS to point across the VPC peering connection. If you aren’t already running internal DNS, UserClouds can repoint our public DNS to make this work.

For more information, please reach out to [info@userclouds.com](mailto:info@userclouds.com).
