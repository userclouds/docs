Once you have populated UserClouds with your types, objects and edges, UserClouds is ready to be the source-of-truth for permissions. To implement <Glossary>permission</Glossary>s in your system, all you need to do is add UserClouds's [Permission Check APIs](https://docs.userclouds.com/reference/get_authz-checkattribute) in the appropriate places in your software.

- **CheckAttribute** answers the question: does user X have permission Y on object Z?
- **ListAttributes** receives a source object ID and target object ID. It returns a list of attributes that the source object has on the target object.
- **ListObjectsReachableWithAttribute** receives an attribute and a source object ID. It returns a list of objects reachable with that attribute.

For more information, check out our [Authorization API Docs](com/reference/get_authz-checkattribute).
