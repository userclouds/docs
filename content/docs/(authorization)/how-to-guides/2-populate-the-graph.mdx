Once you have designed the structure of your model, it's time to build your database of <Glossary>object</Glossary>s and <Glossary>edge</Glossary>s in UserClouds. This can be done in two steps:

- (a) Migrate over from a pre-existing identity system
- (b) Implement UserClouds's APIs to [populate the graph with objects](/reference/post_authz-objects) and [edges](/reference/post_authz-edges) on an ongoing basis

If you are building your product or user base from scratch, you will skip straight to part (b).

## A. Migrate from a pre-existing identity system

UserClouds supports mass migration from pre-existing AuthN and AuthZ systems, like Auth0 and Cognito.

_Docs coming soon! For help migrating over from your existing AuthZ system, please donâ€™t hesitate to email us at [info@userclouds.com](_mailto:info@userclouds.com) ._

## B. Implement Write APIs in your software

Maintaining your authorization graph is simple with UserClouds's CRUD APIs. These allow you to [create Objects](/reference/post_authz-objects) and [Edges](/reference/post_authz-edges) programmatically in your application.

For more information on the APIs for Authorization, check out our [Authorization API Docs](/reference/post_authz-objects).
