UserClouds stores two types of information for every user: 

- **User data** such as their name, email or phone number
- **User consents**: for each column, UserClouds also stores a set of user <Glossary>consent</Glossary>s, indicating which data processing purposes a user has consented to for that column of data

You can update both data and consents using <Glossary>mutator</Glossary>s. Mutators are advanced write APIs. They  enforce access policies, receive inbound data, normalize it, and save it to the specified record(s) and column(s) in the User Store.

UserClouds automatically code-generates an SDK so that calling mutators is as simple as calling any other function in your codebase.
