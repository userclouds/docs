- [Data Transformers](https://docs.userclouds.com/docs/transformers) allow you to manipulate and minimize data
- [Selectors](https://docs.userclouds.com/docs/selectors) are SQL-like clauses that specify which records to retrieve or edit
- [Accessors](https://docs.userclouds.com/docs/accessors-read-apis) are custom read APIs that allow a client to retrieve data from User Store
- [Mutators](https://docs.userclouds.com/docs/mutators-write-apis) are custom write APIs that allow a client to send data to User Store
